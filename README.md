# MS_MachineLearningProject

This repository contains the code and report for the final project of my master's program machine learning course. I don't have the reviewing professor's comments but I know I got a big fat A.

I ended up using an ensembled K-means and random forest to build a model to predict hospital recidivism of diabetic patients.
